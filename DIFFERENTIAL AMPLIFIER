Aim : Design and Analyze the MOS differential amplifier circuitfor the following specifications 
Components Required :N-MOSFET(nmos4),Resistors(3.5k,0.5k,voltage source)
Definiton:A differential amplifier is a type of electronic amplifier that amplifies the difference between two input voltages while rejecting any voltage that is common to both inputs. 
It is a fundamental building block in analog circuits, commonly used in operational amplifiers (op-amps) and instrumentation amplifiers.
