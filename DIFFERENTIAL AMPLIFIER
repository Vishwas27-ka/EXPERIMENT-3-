Aim : Design and Analyze the MOS differential amplifier circuitfor the following specifications 
Components Required :N-MOSFET(nmos4),Resistors(3.5k,0.5k,voltage source)
Definiton:A differential amplifier is a type of electronic amplifier that amplifies the difference between two input voltages while rejecting any voltage that is common to both inputs. 
It is a fundamental building block in analog circuits, commonly used in operational amplifiers (op-amps) and instrumentation amplifiers.
1. Basic Principle
The differential amplifier operates on the principle of differential mode gain and common-mode rejection:
1.Differential Mode: The amplifier amplifies the difference between two input signals.
2.Common Mode: Signals that are common to both inputs (such as noise or interference) are ideally rejected.
Mathematically, the output voltage of an ideal differential amplifier is given by:
Vout =Ad(V1âˆ’V2)
Ad= Differential mode gain
V1=Non inverting Terminal
V2=Inverting Terminal
A basic differential amplifier circuit consists of two identical transistors (BJTs or MOSFETs) or operational amplifiers, forming a symmetrical configuration
3. Modes of Operation:A differential amplifier operates in two primary modes:
   (a) Differential Mode
    Inputs:V1=+V,V2=-V
    The output voltage is proportional to the difference between the inputs.
    Provides high gain.
   (b) Common Mode
   Inputs: V1=V2 (same signal applied to both inputs)
   Ideally, the output should be zero (common-mode rejection).
   Practical circuits have a Common-Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR) to measure the effectiveness of common-mode noise rejection.
